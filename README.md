I built a website similar to Airbnb using Tailwind CSS and HTML. It looks and works like Airbnb, letting people search for places to stay, check out listings, and book accommodations. Tailwind CSS made it easy to style everything, and HTML helped organize the content. The result is a user-friendly website that's just like Airbnb!
